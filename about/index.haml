    I'm Henrik Nyh. I was born July 26, 1983 and live in a suburb of Stockholm, Sweden with [Johanna](http://johannaost.com).

    I currently work as a Ruby on Rails developer at [Auktionskompaniet.com](http://www.auktionskompaniet.com/), a Swedish auction house. I have a master's degree in computational linguistics, though I've found I enjoy computers and linguistics more when they're separate.
    
    My current computer at home is a 1.6 GHz MacBook Air, with a Mac Mini for a HTPC and home server. At work, I use a maxed-out iMac.

    Though I enjoy reading, running and pugs, web development is my main interest. I'm particularly into user interfaces and awesome touches. I love solving small problems really well. I'm very much into automation and hate seeing a human doing a computer's job. I consider myself a pragmatic perfectionist.

    As for the name, I simply like pugs and automation. Oh, and "pug" sounds vaguely like "blog".
