    I'm Henrik Nyh. I was born <span id="birthday">July 26, 1983</span> and live in a suburb of Stockholm, Sweden with [Johanna](http://johannaost.com).

    I currently work as a developer (mostly Ruby on Rails) at [Bukowskis](http://www.bukowskis.com/), a Swedish auction house. I have a master's degree in computational linguistics, though I've found I enjoy computers and linguistics more when they're separate.
    
    I develop in [MacVim](/2011/01/textmate-to-vim-with-training-wheels) on OS X.

    I enjoy reading, running, hitting the gym, photography and pugs, but web development is my main interest. I'm particularly into user interfaces and awesome touches. I love solving small problems really well. I'm very much into automation and hate seeing a human doing a computer's job. I consider myself a pragmatic perfectionist.
    
    You can reach me by e-mail or Jabber at <henrik@nyh.se> or on Twitter as [@henrik](http://twitter.com/henrik).
    
    I also have accounts on [GitHub](http://github.com/henrik), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/malesca/), [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/u:henrik) and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/Malesca/). My Delicious-powered wishlist is at [delishlist.com/malesca](http://delishlist.com/malesca).
    
    ## This blog
    
    This blog is all static files, generated by [my fork of Jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll), with [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for comments.
    
    Unless otherwise noted, all code I publish is under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
    
    As for the name, I simply like pugs and automation. Oh, and "pug" sounds vaguely like "blog".
